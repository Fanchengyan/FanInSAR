FanInSAR is a Fancy Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis library written in Python. It aims to provide a foundational library for the development of InSAR algorithms, facilitating efficient processing of InSAR time series data by offering a Pythonic, fast, and flexible approach. FanInSARâ€™s high-level API abstracts the complex processing pipeline and conceals the low-level programming details, enabling users to focus on algorithm development. For researchers and developers aiming to rapidly implement their own InSAR algorithms, FanInSAR offers a quick start for their projects.


## Highlight Features

- **Pythonic**: FanInSAR is written in Python and provides a user-friendly API. Its API is designed to be simple and intuitive, by abstracting the complex processing pipeline and concealing the low-level programming details, which allows users to focus on algorithm development. For example, loading data from ``HyP3`` or ``LiCSAR`` products is as simple as providing the corresponding home directory. Filtering interferometric pairs can be performed by a time slice, similar to the ``pandas`` package. 
- **Fast**: The core computation in FanInSAR is implemented using ``PyTorch``, a high-performance deep learning library. This allows for efficient processing on both CPU and GPU, enabling faster execution.
- **Flexible**: FanInSAR is designed to be flexible, allowing for customization and extension. Users can easily inherit classes or customize the processing pipeline for their specific needs.

## Installation 

FanInSAR is a Python package, and requires ``Python >= 3.8``. You can install the latest release of FanInSAR using ``pip``:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Fanchengyan/FanInSAR.git
```

## Documentation

The detailed documentation is available at: <https://faninsar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

> :warning: **Note**
> 
>FanInSAR is under active development and is currently in the alpha stage. Its API may change in the future until it reaches a stable version.
