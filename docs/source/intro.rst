Introduction
============

FanInSAR is a fancy InSAR processing library written in Python. It is designed to help you process InSAR data in a fast, flexible and Pythonic way. If you want to implement your InSAR algorithm, FanInSAR is a most recommended choice.

Highlight Features
------------------

- **Fast**: The heavy computation core in FanInSAR is written in ``Pytorch``, a high-performance deep learning library. You can easily run FanInSAR on GPU to speed up the processing.
- **Pythonic**: FanInSAR is written in Python. The API is designed to be simple and intuitive. We design the class structure to be high-level and easy to use for the InSAR user. For example, you can easily load the ``HyP3`` product and process it with a few lines of code. 
- **Flexible**: FanInSAR is designed to be flexible. You can easily inherit the class or customize the processing pipeline to meet your needs.
